# Fluorine

Because configuration is extremely reactive: almost all applications form compounds with fluorine. Fluorine is distributed configuration the Clojure way:

* edn as configuration format
* file based, so it can be easily put under source control
* notifies all connected clients for changes to the configuration subset they are interested in
* provides an easy to install fluorine-client to talk to the fluorine server
* thanks to aleph, fluorine speaks http, tcp and udp.
